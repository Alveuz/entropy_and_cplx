# entropy_and_cplx
A python module used for estimating discrete and differential entropy, as well as measures for characterizing dynamic systems in terms of the Emergence, Self-organization, and Complexity.

## DifferentialEntropy Class

The DifferentialEntropy class is a Python implementation for computing the differential entropy of probability distributions. It provides methods for estimating the entropy of Gaussian and uniform distributions, as well as performing integration to calculate the differential entropy.

### Features

- Compute the differential entropy of Gaussian distributions.
- Compute the differential entropy of uniform distributions.
- Perform integration to calculate the differential entropy for a given distribution type and parameters.
